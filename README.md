# Flat-Taco (Materia)

This is a slight modification on the [materia-theme from nana-4](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) which makes the dark colors a little more blueish.

Please refer to the upstream repository for more information.

## Usage

To compile and install the Flat-Taco compact light theme, run

    ./run.sh

To additionally install the fitting GNOME Terminal theme, run

    ./set-terminal-theme.sh
